Title: SQL Database Design & Implementation for Online Bookstore

Description:

⚪Designed and Developed a Scalable Relational Database: Created a robust and normalized database schema for an online bookstore, incorporating key entities such as books, customers, and orders. This structure is optimized for efficient data storage and retrieval in an e-commerce environment.

⚪Ensured Data Integrity and Referential Consistency: Meticulously defined and enforced `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY` constraints across all tables. This guarantees data accuracy, prevents inconsistencies, and maintains critical relationships between datasets, foundational for reliable transactional processing.

⚪Implemented Automated Data Management: Utilized PostgreSQL sequences to automate the generation of unique identifiers for all primary keys, including book_id, customer_id, and order_id. This approach streamlines data entry, enhances system efficiency, and supports seamless scalability.

⚪Demonstrated Expertise in Database Definition Language (DDL): Proficiently executed DDL operations for database creation, table structuring, sequence management, and constraint definition. This highlights a strong command over foundational SQL for building and maintaining database architectures.

⚪Constructed a Foundation for E-commerce Operations: The designed database serves as a resilient backbone for core e-commerce functionalities, including inventory management, order processing, and customer relationship tracking, showcasing practical application of database principles in a business context.
